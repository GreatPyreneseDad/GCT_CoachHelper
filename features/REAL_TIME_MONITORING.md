# Real-Time Coherence Monitoring Features

## Overview
Integration of advanced real-time coherence tracking capabilities from GCT Assistant into CoachHelper, enabling coaches to monitor client coherence during live sessions, text conversations, and AI interactions.

---

## Feature 1: Session Coherence Derivative Tracker

### Purpose
Monitor and visualize the rate of change (derivative) of coherence during coaching sessions, providing insights into breakthrough moments and regression patterns.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1.1 Real-Time Coherence Calculation
```javascript
// Adapted from GCT Assistant browser extension
class SessionCoherenceTracker {
  constructor() {
    this.scoreLog = [];
    this.sessionStartTime = Date.now();
    this.currentCoherence = null;
    this.derivative = { current: 0, average: 0, trend: 'stable' };
  }

  trackCoherence(text, timestamp = Date.now()) {
    const metrics = this.calculateMetrics(text);
    const elapsed = (timestamp - this.sessionStartTime) / 1000;
    
    this.scoreLog.push({
      time: elapsed,
      score: metrics.overall,
      psi: metrics.psi,
      rho: metrics.rho,
      q: metrics.q,
      f: metrics.f,
      textLength: text.length
    });
    
    this.derivative = this.calculateDerivative();
    return {
      metrics,
      derivative: this.derivative,
      scoreLog: this.scoreLog
    };
  }

  calculateDerivative() {
    if (this.scoreLog.length < 2) return { current: 0, average: 0, trend: 'stable' };
    
    const n = this.scoreLog.length;
    const current = this.scoreLog[n-1];
    const previous = this.scoreLog[n-2];
    const dt = current.time - previous.time;
    const instantaneous = dt > 0 ? (current.score - previous.score) / dt : 0;
    
    // Determine trend
    let trend = 'stable';
    if (instantaneous > 0.01) trend = 'improving';
    else if (instantaneous < -0.01) trend = 'declining';
    
    return { current: instantaneous, average: this.getAverageDerivative(), trend };
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Visual Representation
- **Live Graph**: Real-time coherence curve with derivative overlay
- **Trend Indicators**: ↗️ (improving), → (stable), ↘️ (declining)
- **Breakthrough Markers**: Automatic detection when derivative > 0.05/s
- **Color Coding**: Green (growth), Yellow (plateau), Red (decline)

### Integration Points

#### During Video Sessions
```javascript
// WebRTC audio transcription integration
videoSession.onTranscription((transcript, speaker) => {
  if (speaker === 'client') {
    const analysis = coherenceTracker.trackCoherence(transcript);
    updateCoherenceDisplay(analysis);
    
    // Alert coach to significant changes
    if (analysis.derivative.current > 0.05) {
      notifyCoach('Breakthrough moment detected!');
    }
  }
});
```

#### In Text Chat
```javascript
// Real-time chat analysis
chatInterface.onMessage((message) => {
  const analysis = coherenceTracker.trackCoherence(message.text);
  updateSidePanel(analysis);
  
  // Store for session summary
  sessionData.coherenceLog.push(analysis);
});
```

## Feature 2: Conversation Coherence Analyzer

### Purpose
Analyze the coherence of entire conversations between coach and client, tracking patterns across multiple exchanges.

### Enhanced Metrics for Human Conversations

#### 2.1 Multi-Dimensional Analysis
```javascript
class ConversationCoherenceAnalyzer {
  analyzeExchange(clientText, coachText) {
    return {
      // Standard GCT dimensions
      clientCoherence: this.calculateGCTScore(clientText),
      coachCoherence: this.calculateGCTScore(coachText),
      
      // Conversation-specific metrics
      alignment: this.calculateAlignment(clientText, coachText),
      engagement: this.calculateEngagement(clientText, coachText),
      progressIndicators: this.detectProgress(clientText),
      interventionEffectiveness: this.measureImpact()
    };
  }

  calculateAlignment(clientText, coachText) {
    // Measure how well coach response aligns with client needs
    const clientTopics = this.extractTopics(clientText);
    const coachTopics = this.extractTopics(coachText);
    return this.calculateTopicOverlap(clientTopics, coachTopics);
  }

  detectProgress(text) {
    const progressPatterns = {
      insight: /i realize|i see now|that makes sense|never thought of/gi,
      commitment: /i will|i'll try|starting tomorrow|from now on/gi,
      breakthrough: /aha|wow|incredible|life.changing|game.changer/gi
    };
    
    const indicators = {};
    for (const [key, pattern] of Object.entries(progressPatterns)) {
      indicators[key] = (text.match(pattern) || []).length;
    }
    return indicators;
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Turn-by-Turn Analysis
- **Response Quality**: How well coach addresses client concerns
- **Question Effectiveness**: Impact of coaching questions
- **Emotional Resonance**: Empathy and connection levels
- **Topic Coherence**: Staying focused vs. productive tangents

### Visualization Components

#### Conversation Flow Diagram
```
Client: "I feel stuck..." [Coherence: 45%]
   ↓ (Coach acknowledges + reframes)
Coach: "What would unstuck look like?" [Alignment: 85%]
   ↓ (Client explores possibility)
Client: "Actually, I could..." [Coherence: 62% ↑17%]
   ↓ (Coach reinforces insight)
Coach: "That's a powerful realization!" [Support: 90%]
```

#### Session Coherence Timeline
- X-axis: Time (minutes)
- Y-axis: Coherence score
- Dual lines: Client (solid) and Coach (dashed)
- Shaded areas: High-alignment zones
- Markers: Breakthrough moments

## Feature 3: AI Interaction Monitor

### Purpose
Track coherence when clients interact with AI tools, homework apps, or automated check-ins.

### Implementation

#### 3.1 Browser Extension for Client Portal
```javascript
// Client-side coherence monitoring
class ClientPortalMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.extensionId = 'gct-coachhelper-monitor';
    this.sessionData = [];
  }

  monitorAIInteraction() {
    // Track when client uses AI features
    this.onAIResponse((response, context) => {
      const coherence = this.analyzeCoherence(response);
      this.sessionData.push({
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        context,
        coherence,
        clientReaction: null // Updated when client responds
      });
      
      // Send to coach dashboard if significant
      if (coherence.overall < 0.4 || coherence.derivative < -0.05) {
        this.alertCoach({
          type: 'low_coherence_ai_interaction',
          details: coherence
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Integration with Homework Assignments
- Monitor coherence of client journal entries
- Track progress in self-guided exercises
- Analyze check-in response quality
- Flag concerning patterns for coach review

---

## Feature 4: Pattern Recognition & Alerts

### Coherence Patterns to Detect

#### 4.1 Positive Patterns
- **Breakthrough Cascade**: Rapid coherence increase across dimensions
- **Integration Phase**: Steady rise after processing period
- **Confidence Building**: Progressive q (activation) improvement
- **Connection Deepening**: f (belonging) correlation with overall coherence

#### 4.2 Concerning Patterns
- **Coherence Collapse**: Sudden drop across dimensions
- **Stagnation Spiral**: Flat derivative for extended period
- **Dimension Disconnect**: One dimension significantly lagging
- **Session Regression**: End-of-session coherence < beginning

### Alert System
```javascript
class CoherenceAlertSystem {
  constructor(thresholds) {
    this.thresholds = {
      breakthroughDerivative: 0.05,
      collapseDerivative: -0.05,
      stagnationDuration: 300, // 5 minutes
      dimensionGap: 0.3
    };
  }

  checkAlerts(currentAnalysis, historicalData) {
    const alerts = [];
    
    // Breakthrough detection
    if (currentAnalysis.derivative.current > this.thresholds.breakthroughDerivative) {
      alerts.push({
        type: 'breakthrough',
        severity: 'positive',
        message: 'Client experiencing breakthrough - reinforce insights!',
        suggestedAction: 'Slow down and help integrate'
      });
    }
    
    // Stagnation detection
    if (this.detectStagnation(historicalData)) {
      alerts.push({
        type: 'stagnation',
        severity: 'warning',
        message: 'Conversation may be stuck',
        suggestedAction: 'Try pattern interrupt or new angle'
      });
    }
    
    return alerts;
  }
}
```

### Metrics

#### 5.1 Intervention Effectiveness Score
```javascript
calculateInterventionImpact(preIntervention, postIntervention) {
  const coherenceChange = postIntervention.coherence - preIntervention.coherence;
  const timeToImpact = postIntervention.timestamp - preIntervention.timestamp;
  const sustainedImpact = this.checkSustainability(postIntervention);
  
  return {
    immediateImpact: coherenceChange,
    responseTime: timeToImpact,
    sustainability: sustainedImpact,
    effectiveness: this.calculateEffectivenessScore(coherenceChange, timeToImpact, sustainedImpact)
  };
}
```

#### 5.2 Coach Coherence Correlation
