### Phase 2: GCT Crash Course (10 minutes)

#### Screen 3: The Big Idea
```
The Science of Human Transformation

Traditional coaching measures surface actions.
GCT measures deep coherence - the alignment between:

🧭 Values & Actions (Ψ - Consistency)
🧠 Experience & Learning (ρ - Wisdom)
💪 Knowledge & Courage (q - Activation)
🤝 Self & Community (f - Belonging)

When these align, transformation accelerates exponentially.

#### Screen 4: Interactive Coherence Demo
```
Let's see coherence in action...

Meet Sample Client "Alex":
                    Low Coherence (45%)
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ψ: Says health matters, skips workouts │
│ ρ: Keeps making same mistakes         │
│ q: Knows what to do, but doesn't      │
│ f: Isolated, no accountability        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Slide to see transformation →]

                    High Coherence (78%)
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Ψ: Daily habits match values          │
│ ρ: Learns quickly from setbacks       │
│ q: Takes bold action despite fear     │
│ f: Supported growth community         │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Your job: Guide clients from left to right.

```

#### Screen 5: The Multiplier Effect
```
Here's the Secret Sauce 🔮

Consistency (Ψ) multiplies everything else!

Low Ψ (0.3):                High Ψ (0.9):
Wisdom impact: 30%          Wisdom impact: 90%
Support impact: 30%         Support impact: 90%

Same wisdom, same support - 3x the results!

This is why we always check alignment first.

### Phase 4: Hands-On Practice (7 minutes)

#### Screen 8: Practice Assessment
```
Let's practice with "Sample Sarah"

You'll ask her these assessment questions.
Notice how each maps to a dimension:

"This week, my actions matched my stated priorities..."

Sarah's response: "Somewhat (50-69%)"

This measures: Ψ (Consistency)

[Continue Practice →]

(Walk through 3-4 questions with explanations)
```

#### Screen 9: Interpret Results
```
Sample Sarah's Results:

Coherence: 52% (Growing Zone)

Ψ: 45% - Misaligned actions
ρ: 70% - Good self-awareness  
q: 40% - Fear blocking action
f: 65% - Decent support

What pattern do you see?
○ The Wise Coward (High ρ, Low q) ✓
○ The Lonely Hero (Low f, High q)
○ The People Pleaser (Low Ψ, High f)

Correct! Sarah knows what to do but fear stops her.

[Plan Intervention →]
```

#### Screen 10: Choose Intervention
```
Based on Sarah's pattern, which intervention would you try first?

○ Values Clarification Workshop
○ Micro-Courage Challenge ✓
○ Relationship Audit
○ Wisdom Extraction Ritual

Excellent choice! 

The Micro-Courage Challenge builds her courage muscle with small daily acts, perfect for her low q score.
